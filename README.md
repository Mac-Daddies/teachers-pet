Teacher's Pet
=============

A reinvented gradebook web application that helps save teachers time and energy through one-click email functionality, easy curving with preset algorithms,
and beautiful visuals of grade data.

Teacher's Pet provides teachers all of the utilities of a basic gradebook along with:

Email Functionality
-------------------
* Email parents individual student progress reports based on a template filled with retrieved gradebook data for that student,
including average, missing assignments and due dates, and teacher contact info
* Email the parents of entire sets of students at once, such as all students who have one or more missing assignments or all students
who have a certain average or higher, at the click of one button
* Edit email settings to personalize templates and criteria
* COMING SOON: Even ore email customization

Curving Functionality
---------------------
* Curve test scores using any of three curving algorithms at the click of a button
* Decide which curve is most appropriate for your assignment by comparing the sets of uncurved and curved grade data on responsive
distribution graphs
* Revert to original grades at any time- our app keeps a record so you don't have to!
* Add extra credit to your students' test grades at once rather than individually
* View your grade data on different screens depending on your preferences: gradebook view, graph view, or split view
* COMING SOON: More curves from which to choose, more customization of the distribution graphs
